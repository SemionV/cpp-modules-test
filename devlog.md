**TODO:**
* Separate module interface unit from module implementation unit
* Make an example with statically polymorphic classes and their dependencies
* Build a dll library, which is instantiating the templates and provides module interface units
* Make an installation of the dll library in order to use by consumers
* Make a separate project, which is building an executable, which is using the dll library
* Make a separate project which is building a dll extension to the executable and provides some extra functionality
